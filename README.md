# Helicopter Mania
A 2D helicopter game with the goal of avoiding obstacles and staying alive.

I created this as a project for Programming 11 in high school.

## How to run
CodeSkulptor's libraries are required, so the easiest way to run would be to use its online environment:

- Copy the text in the python file, go to https://py2.codeskulptor.org/, paste it and then click run
- Or alternatively, go to https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user46_ZtjVsvWbit_10.py to open the script I saved and then click run
